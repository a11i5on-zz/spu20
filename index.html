                        <img src="img/miescher.jpg" class="pics"/>
                        <p>
                     		<h3>Summary</h3>
                            Miescher was working under Enrst Hoppe-Seyler at the University of Tubingen when he began collecting white blood cells from pus. He then lysed the cells and isolated a substance which he called "nuclei", which was high in phosphorus. "Nuclei" was what we call nucleic acid now.  
                            <h3>The Process</h3>
                            <ol>
                            	<li>Miescher's aim was to determine the chemical composition of cells. Miescher first attempted to use lymph nodes to do this; however, it was difficult to purify the lymphocytes (a specific type of white blood cell) and obtain sufficient quantities for analysis. </li>
                            	<li>Hoppe-Seyler suggested Miescher instead find leucocytes (general white blood cells). Miescher obtained his samples from the pus on fresh surgical bandages from a nearby clinic. </li>
                            	<li>Initially, Miescher invested himself on studying the different proteins that constituted the lecocytes because at the time, proteins were considered the most interesting and potentially enlightening material with regards to cell function.</li>
                            	<li>However, in the process of conducting these experiments, Miescher noticed that a substance precipitated from the solution when acid was added and dissolved again when alkali was added. He began designing a new protocol to isolate this precipitate from the proteins. His first protocol did not produce enough of the purified precipitate, so he created a second protocol.</li>
                            	<li>
                            		In his second protocol, Miescher did the following: 
                            		<ol>
                            			<li>Added pepsin (a proteolytic enzyme that digests protein), which he obtained by washing pig stomachs with a mixture (fuming hydrochloric acid and water) and filtering the resulting solution many times.</li>
                            			<li>Removed the lipids from his leucocytes by washing them with alcohol (something he didn't do in his original protocol). </li>
                            			<li>Isolated the precipitate by letting the residual material digest with the pepsin solution. He repeated this step many times, replacing the pepsin solution every time.</li>
                            			<li>Steps 1-3 yielded a precipitate of nuclei without any attached cytoplasm formed. He mechanically removed the lipids, and filtered the remaining nuclei and washed them with water and alcohol to remove any remaining bits of protein.</li>
                            			<li>From this precipitate, Miescher extracted nuclei with the same alkaline extraction protocol he had developed from an earlier protocol and then adding acetic acid to cause the nuclei to precipitate.</li>
                            		</ol>
                            	</li>
                            	
                            </ol>
                            While Miescher was unable to determine much about the function of his newfound "nuclein", he assumed (correctly) that it played a major role in cell function. He realized that the presence of nuclein in the nucleus created an important chemical difference between a cell's cytoplasm and the nucleus, but neither him nor his contemporaries were able to make any further progress at the time.

                        <p>
                        	<h3>Summary</h3>
                            In 1944, Oswald Avery (along with Maclyn McCarty and Colin MacLeod) ran an experiment to identify what their predecessor, Griffith, called the "transforming principle" that encodes genetic information. <br />
                            To do so, they began with large cultures of heat-killed S cells and removing a potential transforming principle (protein, RNA, or DNA). They then added R cells and waited to see whether S cells would appear. As we can see through the diagram to the right, this allowed the scientists to determine that DNA was the transforming principle.
                            <h3>The Process</h3>
                            There are 4 major steps in running this experiment (per Avery's research paper): 
                            <ol>
                            	<li>Killing the bacteria with heat and extracting the saline-soluble components.</li>
                            	<li>Precipitating the protein out using chloroform and hydrolyzing the polysaccharide capsules with an enzyme.</li>
                            	<li>Using an immunological precipitation caused by type-specific antibodies to verify the complete destruction of the capsules.</li>
                            	<li>Precipitating out the active portion by alcohol fractionation, which would then be removed using a stirring rod.</li>
                            </ol>
							​These active portions were shown to be effective even with trypsin, chymotrypsin, and ribonuclease (enzymes that destroy RNA and proteins), but not with deoxyribonucleodepolymerase (which breaks down DNA) added. These results suggested that DNA was the transforming principle. <br />
							However, the scientists' findings were met with a mixed response. While many members of the scientific community believed the results, some still held that DNA was insufficiently complex to be the genetic material of a cell.

                        <p>
                        	<h3>Summary</h3>
                             In 1947, the American scientist Erwin Chargaff found that the amount of adenine equaled the amount of thymine in DNA, and that the amount of guanine equaled the amount of cytosine. However, he was unable to connect this to the structure of DNA.
                             <h3>The Process</h3>
                             Chargaff used the (at the time) new technique of paper chromatography to reach the conclusions that later became known as Chargaff's Rule. Here is a simplified version of the process: 
                             <ol>
                             	<li>To separate the DNA, acid was added to hydrolyze the phosphodiester bonds and break up the DNA's backbone, leaving individual nucleotides. </li>
                             	<li>Ultraviolet spectrophotometry was used to analyze the exact amounts of bases that were present in the DNA sample, which showed that there were an unequal amount of purine bases (Adenine and Guanine) and pyrimidine bases (Cytosine and Guanine).</li>
                             </ol>
                             Thus, Chargaff's findings disproved the pre-existing "tetranucleotide hypothesis", which had incorrectly asserted “that DNA was made up of equal amounts of four bases – adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine". Although Chargaff was unable to link this to DNA's double-helix stucture, this experiment was later a significant part of determining DNA's structure.

                        	<h3>Summary</h3>
                            To determine whether DNA was the genetic material of a cell, Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase conducted several experiments involving T2 bacteriophages (viruses), radioactive sulfur and phosphorus, and E. coli. They grew bacteriophages in sulfur so that the protein would contain sulfur, as well as in phosphorus so that the phosphorus would be present in DNA. They then allowed the phages to infect some E. coli and then separated the bacteria and virus using centrifugation. The resulting bacterial pellet was found to be radioactive when infected by the phosphorus-tagged viruses, but not with the sulfur-tagged ones. This supported the idea that DNA was the genetic material, not protein.

                        <p>
                        	<h3>Summary</h3>
                            Watson and Crick determined that DNA was a double-helix polymer. Their discovery was aided by Rosalind Franklin's X-ray diffraction image of DNA.  
                            <h3>The Process</h3>
                            Unlike the other classical "experiments", Watson and Crick's discovery resulted more from the synthesis of pre-existing evidence other experiments. 
                            <ol>
                            	<li>Watson and Crick began with a three-stranded model of DNA, similarly to Linus Pauling's. This model was quickly proved to be false. </li>
                            	<li>They also created a model where like bases were paired (for example, adenine with adenine). This model was also quickly disproved. </li>
                            	<li>However, they eventually synthesized evidence from the following contemporaries: 
                            		<ul>
                            			<li><strong>Jerry Donohue</strong> (a visiting physical chemist from the United States who shared Watson and Crick's office for the year) pointed out that the configuration for the rings of carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen (the elements of all four bases) in thymine and guanine given in most textbooks of chemistry was incorrect. This inspired Watson to put the two bases into their correct form in cardboard models by moving a hydrogen atom from a position where it bonded with oxygen to a neighboring position where it bonded with nitrogen.</li>
                            			<li>Watson and Crick also used the results that <strong>Chargaff</strong> produced; their final model accounted for equal amounts of Adenine and Thymine, as well as Guanine and Cytocine.</li>
                            			<li>Their model was also corroborated by <strong>Rosalind Franklin's</strong> X-ray, which showed an agreeing structure to their model. Her evidence demonstrated that the two sugar-phosphate backbones lay on the outside of the molecule, confirmed Watson and Crick's conjecture that the backbones formed a double helix, and revealed to Crick that they were antiparallel. </li>
                            		</ul>
                            	</li>

                        	<h3>Summary</h3>
                            Called the "most beautiful experiment in biology", the Meselson-Stahl experiment was conducted by Matt Meselson and Franklin Stahl. It supported Watson and Crick's hypothesis that DNA replication was semiconservative. In semiconservative replication, when the double stranded DNA helix is replicated, each of the two new double-stranded DNA helices consisted of one strand from the original helix and one newly synthesized.   
                            <h3>The Process</h3>
                            At a high level, Meselson and Stahl's experiment (per their original research paper) is as follows: 
                            <ol>
                            	<li>E. coli B was grown at 36 degrees C; this was followed by microscopic cell counts and colony assays. These bacteria were labeled with N-15 by growing them for 14 generations in medium containing 100 micrograms/ml of N15H4Cl of 96.5% isotopic purity.</li>
                            	<li>To abruptly put these bacteria in an N-14 environment, a tenfold excess of N14H4Cl was added to the culture along with adenine ribosides and uracil in experiment 1 and ribosides of adenine, guanine, uracil and cytosine in experiment 2. </li>
                            	<li>For several generations, Meselson and Stahl took samples containing approximately 4 * 10<sup>9</sup> bacteria, immediately chilled and centrifuged them, and resuspended them in 0.4ml of a cold solution 0.01 M in NaCl and 0.01 M in EDTA at pH 6. They were then lysed with sodium dodecyl sulfate and stored.</li>
                            	<li>For density-gradient centrifugation, 0.01 ml of the dodecyl sulfate lysate was added to 0.7 ml of CsCl sollution buffered at pH 8.5, and centrifuged to isolate a band of DNA. </li>
                            </ol>
                            These bands of DNA that showed up allowed Meselson and Stahl to determine how the DNA was replicating. Because the first generation produced one band of DNA that was in between the density of pure N14 and N15 DNA, this ruled out the conservative model of DNA replication. The second generation DNA produced 2 bands when centrifuged, which indicated a semiconservative model of replication (NOT dispersive, the alternative option).

                        	<h3>Summary</h3>
                            The experiment deciphered the first of the 64 triplet codons in the genetic code by using nucleic acid homopolymers to translate specific amino acids. <br />
                            In the experiment, an extract from bacterial cells that could make protein even when no intact living cells were present was prepared. Adding an artificial form of RNA, poly-U, to this extract caused it to make a protein composed entirely of the amino acid phenylalanine. This showed that RNA controlled the production of specific types of protein, and that "UUU" corresponded to phenylalanine. 
                            <h3>The Process</h3>
                            In order to show that RNA could trigger specific protein synthesis, Nirenberg worked with his post doctoral fellow, Heinrich Matthaei, on the following procedure: 
                            <ol>
                            	<li>They first ground E. coli cells up using a mortar and pestle to release the cytoplasm. Because the remaining cytoplasm could still synthesize protein when RNA is added, this simplified the experiment significantly. </li> 
                            	<li>The experiment used 20 test tubes, each filled with a different amino acid and the E.coli cytoplasm. For each individual experiment, 19 test tubes were “cold” and one was radioactively tagged to make results more observable.</li>
                        		<li>When Matthaei added synthetic RNA made only of uracil (called poly-U) to each of the test-tubes, the one containing phenylalanine reacted, showing 38,000 counts per milligram of protein (compared to the control test tubes' average of 70 counts).</li>
                            </ol>
							The experiment showed that a chain of the repeating bases uracil forced a protein chain made of one repeating amino acid, phenylalanine. Nirenberg continued his work with decoding codons with Philip Leder afterwards; simultaneously, Har Gobind Khorana of the University of Wisconsin was also working on decoding codons. Leder and Nirenberg were able to determine the sequences of 54 out of 64 codons in their experiments, and the remaining were discovered by Khorana. Khorana and Nirenberg received the 1968 Nobel prize for their work.
