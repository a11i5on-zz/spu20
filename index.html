                            Miescher was working under Enrst Hoppe-Seyler at the University of Tubingen when he began collecting white blood cells from pus. He then lysed the cells and isolated a substance which he called "nuclei", which was high in phosphorus. "Nuclei" was what we call nucleic acid now.

                            In 1944, Oswald Avery (along with Maclyn McCarty and Colin MacLeod) ran an experiment to identify what their predecessor, Griffith, called the "transforming principle" that encodes genetic information. <br />
                            To do so, they began with large cultures of heat-killed S cells and removing a potential transforming principle (protein, RNA, or DNA). They then added R cells and waited to see wehter S cells would appear. As we can see through the diagram to the right, this allowed the scientists to determine that DNA was the transforming principle.

                             In 1947, the American scientist Erwin Chargaff found that the amount of adenine equaled the amount of thymine in DNA, and that the amount of guanine equaled the amount of cytosine. However, he was unable to connect this to the structure of DNA.

                        <p>
                            To determine whether DNA was the genetic material of a cell, Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase conducted several experiments involving T2 bacteriophages (viruses), radioactive sulfur and phosphorus, and E. coli. They grew bacteriophages in sulfur so that the protein would contain sulfur, as well as in phosphorus so that the phosphorus would be present in DNA. They then allowed the phages to infect some E. coli and then separated the bacteria and virus using centrifugation. The resulting bacterial pellet was found to be radioactive when infected by the phosphorus-tagged viruses, but not with the sulfur-tagged ones. This supported the idea that DNA was the genetic material, not protein.

                            Called the "most beautiful experiment in biology", the Meselson-Stahl experiment was conducted by Matt Meselson and Franklin Stahl. It supported Watson and Crick's hypothesis that DNA replication was semiconservative. In semiconservative replication, when the double stranded DNA helix is replicated, each of the two new double-stranded DNA helices consisted of one strand from the original helix and one newly synthesized.

                            The experiment deciphered the first of the 64 triplet codons in the genetic code by using nucleic acid homopolymers to translate specific amino acids. <br />
                            In the experiment, an extract from bacterial cells that could make protein even when no intact living cells were present was prepared. Adding an artificial form of RNA, poly-U, to this extract caused it to make a protein composed entirely of the amino acid phenylalanine. This showed that RNA controlled the production of specific types of protein, and that "UUU" corresponded to phenylalanine.
